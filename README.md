Noughts and Crosses
===================
a.k.a. Tic Tac Toe
------------------

A Noughts and Crosses game where the computer plays against itself.

Written by Dr. Gavin T.D. Greig, July 2015.

Dependencies
------------
The projects in this solution depend on the NuGet package manager, 
and NuGet packages that apply StyleCop style-checking rules to the
source code. An external installation of StyleCop should not be
required.

The Unit Test project also depends on packages that integrate NUnit
functionality into Visual Studio. An external installation of NUnit
should not be required.

Otherwise, this solution should be self-contained, although
unfortunately it has not been possible to test this on a machine
with minimal development software installed.

Impediments
-----------
* First time using GitHub
* First time using Markdown
* Actual hours available: 8 (initial estimate)
